Welcome to Durfy's Bakery, where our baking traditions have been a cornerstone of family and community since 1909. Our journey began in the verdant fields of Ireland, where our ancestors first mastered the craft of baking, delivering their freshly made breads through the streets with a quaint bread wagon.

Seeking new horizons, our family moved to Windsor, Canada, and established a bakery that quickly became a neighborhood favorite. There, our Irish-inspired recipes brought people together, turning the simple act of sharing bread into a form of community building.

In the 1950s, we embarked on a new adventure, relocating to Westland, Michigan. Here, we opened another chapter of our bakery, continuing the traditions that defined our family's legacy. Later, we expanded to Garden City, on Middlebelt Road, where we further rooted our presence in the community.

Unfortunately, with the passing of our beloved Great Grandpa Durfy, the Michigan bakeries closed their doors, marking the end of an era. However, the spirit of Durfyâ€™s Bakery could not be extinguished. Today, my brother and I are proud to bring back the cherished baking traditions of the Durfy family to Livingston County.

At Durfy's Bakery, we pride ourselves on maintaining the high standards of quality and authenticity that have been our hallmark for over a century. We still use many of the original recipes, each batch baked with the same dedication and passion as our forebears did from their humble bread wagon.
