As we build up our revenue, we are currently operating under cottage law, selling our goods person to person and at local farm markets. This approach allows us to reconnect with our community roots and gather the support needed to eventually open a storefront. 

We are currently limiting our baking to Cinnamon rolls and Snickerdoodle cookies.
